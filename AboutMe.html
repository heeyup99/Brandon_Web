    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Brandon Lee, I was born in Inglewood, NJ, living there for 7 years until I moved south to North Carolina where I lived there for 12 years. I am 23 years old . While in North Carolina I attended UNC Charlotte for 2 years, my major being Business Administration. Now I am finishing my last semester at BMCC pursuing a degree in Computer Network Technology, and planning to pursue a Bachelors in Information Technology at Montclair State University in the spring.

    <p> A few things I enjoy are video games, sports, and music. My favorite sport is soccer and I am a big fan of Tottenham Hotspurs, a team in the English Premier League. The sport I enjoy playing the most however is lacrosse, which I played for 8 years and still a fan of. For video games I enjoy playing classic FPS or the occasional indie releases that have unique gameplay or storylines. My taste in music is pretty basic, I like hip-hop/rap, my favorite artists are J.Cole, Kanye West, and Frank Ocean.
