<h1>We Must STOP Bullying</h1>
<p1>What is Bullying?</p1>
    
    <p>Bullying is the treatment toward another individual that is generally aggressive, repeated over time, and represents an imbalance of real or perceived power.

<p3>Affects of Bullying</p3>
    <p>Individuals who are bullied may have negative impacts in many aspects in life such as</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Physical Health</li>
    <li>Mental and Emotional Health</li>
    <li>Academic Standing</li>
    <li>Social Standing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These effects may cause trauma and affect those continuing into adulthood</p>
    
 <p3>Prevention</p3>
    <p>Teaching children what bullying is and how to confront it safely can help them. It is important to educate them on different ways to get help. <br>
        Keeping a safe and open communication with your children will help them be more comfortable bringing up rather uncomfortable situations/conversations. Keeping the constant communication can also help you as the parent, to noticing when something is off.<br>
        Being a role model to your children and showing them how to treat others respectfully and kindly will help them replicate those actions.</p>
